# Childhood Pneumonia Data and Machine Learning Algorithms

Description:
This repository contains all developed database and scripts: 
i) a relevant data dictionary built alongside a domain specialist based on different factors correlated to pneumonia; 
ii) machine learning algorithms for analyzing and predicting potential childhood pneumonia deaths with high accuracy;
iii) a consistent database as baseline for training and testing the algorithms.
