# Childhood Pneumonia Data and Machine Learning Algorithms
 
 
Description: This repository contains all developed database and scripts:
i) a relevant data dictionary built alongside a domain specialist based on different factors correlated to pneumonia; 
ii) machine learning algorithms for analyzing and predicting potential childhood pneumonia deaths with high accuracy; 
iii) a consistent database as a baseline for training and testing the algorithms.

Configuring the Environment (how to run the experiments):
====================================================================
 
- To configure the environment, Python 3.9 was used with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, tensorflow and scikit-learn.
To install these libraries, use pip:
* pip install pandas
* pip install numpy
* pip install tensorflow
* pip install sklearn
